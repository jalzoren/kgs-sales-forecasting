# Capstone: Sales Forecasting in Supply Chain using XGBoost and LSTM Algorithms in a Korean Grocery Store

## Overview
This capstone project focuses on developing a sales forecasting system for a Korean grocery store using two powerful algorithms — **eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**.  
The primary goal is to improve sales prediction accuracy to support better inventory management and supply chain efficiency.

The project demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning techniques can be applied to retail demand forecasting, helping store managers make data-driven decisions in restocking and demand planning.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for accurate sales forecasting.  
- Compare the performance of XGBoost and LSTM models.  
- Generate short-term, mid-term, and long-term sales forecasts (weekly, monthly, yearly).  
- Support better inventory and supply chain decision-making.  
- Provide a simple, functional user interface for forecast generation and visualization.

## Scope
The scope of this study is **Sales Forecasting in Supply Chain using eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Algorithms** in a Korean grocery store.  
The focus product category will include **commonly sold items** within the store.

The forecasting horizon will cover **short-term to mid-term predictions**, specifically generating **weekly, monthly, and yearly sales forecasts** to help replenish inventory.  
Forecasts will be **manually generated by the store manager** using the system’s interface.

The system will include:
- A **basic functional user interface** for data input, processing, and visualization of forecasts.  
- **Manual file upload** (CSV or Excel) for sales data input.  
- **Simple inventory alerts** after prediction:
  - **High sales alert** → possible risk of stockout  
  - **Low sales alert** → possible risk of overstock  



The system’s purpose is to **provide insights and alerts**, not to make automated decisions.  
The final restocking decision remains the **responsibility of the store manager**, based on experience and contextual understanding.
